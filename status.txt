# Status

## Bugs

* the minimize command does not handle any special case
    * if the input file does not exist
    * if the input file is of complexity zero

* the command line app does not catch signals, so it can't tell
the user which file is the most minimized at the end. This may be
solved by only keeping the most minimal version of a file at any point,
or by catching signals and displaying a message

* all file errors are ignored, they should be displayed and explained
to the usere

## Features

* support more kind of tracing
    * level 4
    * indir?
    * gep?

* build a cargo fuzzcheck tool that manage the fuzzcheck dependency automatically

* use clap to build a proper command line app with a good interface

* create default generators for most basic types 

## Documentation

* there is none currently, but most of it can be ported from the Swift project
    * ensure it builds correctly with rust doc
