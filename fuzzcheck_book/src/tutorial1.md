# Tutorial 1: a binary search tree

In this tutorial, we write a simple data structure and test its API with fuzzcheck. 
The goal is to learn the basics, that is:

* the requirements for a type or function to be fuzz-testable
* how to create a default `Mutator` for a custom type through fuzzcheckâ€™s procedural macros
* how to use `serde` to serialize interesting values and artifacts to the type system
* how to use the cargo-fuzzcheck command line tool
* how to interpret the files generated by fuzzcheck

The data structure we choose to implement is a binary search tree. We create a new tree
with `Tree::empty()`, insert a value into the tree with `tree.insert(x)`, and search for 
a value in the tree with `tree.contains(&x)`.

We will create a fuzz target that tests whether the tree
1. behaves like a proper set
2. does not crash

And we will see how, even when fuzzcheck does not find any failures, we can analyze its
output to gain insight into our code.
