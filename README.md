# fuzzcheck

Fuzzcheck is a structure-aware and coverage-guided fuzzing engine for Rust 
functions.

Given a function `test: (T) -> bool`, you can use fuzzcheck to find a value of
type `T` that fails the test or leads to a crash.

Fuzzcheck works by maintaining a pool of test inputs and ranking them using
the uniqueness of the code coverage caused by running `test(input)`. 
From that pool, it selects a high-ranking input, mutates it, and runs the test
function again. If the new mutated input has an interesting code coverage then
it is added to the pool, otherwise, fuzzcheck tries again with a different 
input and mutation.

In pseudocode:

```rust
loop {
    let input = pool.select();
    mutate(&mut input);

    let analysis = analyze(test, &input);

    match analysis {
        Failed => reportFailure(input),
        Interesting(score) => pool.add(input, score),
        NotInteresting => continue
    }
}
```

Fuzzcheck is unique because, unlike other coverage-guided fuzzing engines, it 
doesn't work with bitstrings but instead works with values of any type `T` 
directly. The complexity of the inputs and the way to mutate them is given by 
functions defined by the user.

## Setup

Rust nightly is required. You can install it with:
```
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

While it is not strictly necessary, installing the `cargo-fuzzcheck` 
executable will make it easier to run fuzzcheck.
```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzzcheck
```

In you `Cargo.toml` file, add `fuzzcheck` as a dev dependency:
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
fuzzcheck = "0.7"
```

Some of the code generated by fuzzcheck’s procedural macros requires 
Rust nightly features. You should enable them at the top of the
`src/lib.rs` file:
```rust
#![cfg_attr(tests, feature(no_coverage))]
#![cfg_attr(tests, feature(arc_new_cyclic))]
```

## Usage

Imagine you would like to verify that a certain function never crashes: 
```rust
// src/lib.rs

#[derive(Clone)]
struct SampleStruct<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U
}

#[derive(Clone)]
enum SampleEnum {
    A(u16),
    B,
    C { x: bool, y: bool } 
}
fn should_not_crash(xs: &[SampleStruct<u8, SampleEnum>]) {
    if xs.len() > 3
        && xs[0].x == 100
        && matches!(xs[0].y, SampleEnum::C { x: false, y: true })
        && xs[1].x == 55
        && matches!(xs[1].y, SampleEnum::C { x: true, y: false })
        && xs[2].x == 87
        && matches!(xs[2].y, SampleEnum::C { x: false, y: false })
        && xs[3].x == 24
        && matches!(xs[3].y, SampleEnum::C { x: true, y: true })
    {
        panic!()
    }
}
```
First, create a test function in the same file, it will contain the fuzz test:
```rust
#[cfg(tests)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_that_function_should_really_not_crash() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The first step is to tell the fuzzer how to generate values of type 
`SampleStruct` and `SampleEnum`. To do so, we can use the
`DefaultMutator` procedural macro:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(tests, fuzzcheck::DefaultMutator)]
#[derive(Clone)]
struct SampleStruct<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U
}

#[cfg_attr(tests, fuzzcheck::DefaultMutator)]
#[derive(Clone)]
enum SampleEnum {
    A(u16),
    B,
    C { x: std::ops::Range<u16>, y: bool } 
}
```

Then, we need a way to serialize values of type `SampleStruct` and `SampleEnum`. By default, 
fuzzcheck uses `serde_json` for that purpose (but it can be changed). That means our data types
should implement serde's traits. In `Cargo.toml`, add:
```
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```
And in `src/lib.rs`:
```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}

#[cfg_attr(tests, fuzzcheck::DefaultMutator)]
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct SampleStruct<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U
}

#[cfg_attr(tests, fuzzcheck::DefaultMutator)]
#[derive(Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum SampleEnum {
    A(u16),
    B,
    C { x: std::ops::Range<u16>, y: bool } 
}
```

We're now ready to implement `test_that_function_should_really_not_crash`.
To launch the fuzzer, we use a builder pattern, as follows:

```rust
#[cfg(tests)]
mod tests {
    use fuzzcheck::FuzzerBuilder;
    #[test]
    fn test_that_function_should_really_not_crash() {
        FuzzerBuilder::test(should_not_crash) // first give the function to test
            // second, the mutator to generate the function’s inputs
            .mutator(<Vec<SampleStruct<u8, SampleEnum>>>::default_mutator()) 
            // third, the serializer, which we chose to be based on serde
            .serializer(fuzzcheck::SerdeSerializer::default())
            // finally, we take the rest of the arguments from the cargo-fuzzcheck tool
            .arguments_from_cargo_fuzzcheck()
            // we're now ready to launch the fuzzer!
            .launch()
    }
}
```

We can now use `cargo-fuzzcheck` to launch the test, using Rust nightly:
```sh
# first argument is the *exact* path to the test function
# second argument is the action to perform. In this case, "fuzz"
cargo +nightly fuzzcheck tests::test_function_doesnt_crash fuzz
```

This starts a loop that will stop when a failing test has been found.

A line will be printed whenever a newsworthy event happened, along with some
statistics. For example:

```
NEW     1004619 score: 34.30    pool: 29        exec/s: 1832012 cplx: 110.55
```

* `NEW` means that a new input was added to the pool of interesting inputs
* `1,004,619` is the number of iterations that were performed so far
* `score: 34.30` is a measure of the total code coverage caused by all inputs
in the pool
* `pool: 29` is the number of inputs in the pool
* `exec/s: 1,832,012` is the average number of iterations performed every second
* `cplx: 128.94` is the average complexity of the inputs in the pool

When a failing test has been found, the following is printed:
```
================ TEST FAILED ================
2828995 score: 57.80    pool: 50        exec/s: 1745441 cplx: 141.34	
Saving at "fuzz/artifacts/target1/2a71aa786f3e552b.json"
```

Here, the path to the artifact file is 
`fuzz/artifacts/target1/2a71aa786f3e552b.json`. 
It contains the JSON-encoded input that failed the test.

```json
[
    {
    "a": 0,
    "b": [
      2,
      null,
      187
    ],
    "c": {
      "kind": "C"
    }
  },
  {
    "a": 189,
    "b": [
      89,
      null,
      213,
      189,
      null,
      32
    ],
    "c": {
      "kind": "A",
      "payload": {
        "0": 7
      }
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

Moreover, the fuzzer can maintain a copy of its input pool in the file system,
which is located by default at `fuzz/corpora/<target>`. Fuzzing corpora 
are useful to kick-start a fuzzing process by providing a list of known 
interesting inputs. If you try to run the fuzzer again, you will see that it
finds the problematic input instantly. This is because it first read the values
written inside the fuzz corpus and used them as starting points.

## Minifying failing test inputs

Fuzzcheck can also be used to *minify* a large input that fails a test.

Let's say you have a file `crash.json` containing an input that you would like
to minify:

```json
[
  {
    "a": 0,
    "b": [2, null, 187],
    "c": 9
  },
  {
    "a": 189,
    "b": [89, null, 213, 189, null, 32],
    "c": 19
  },
  ...
]
```

Launch `cargo-fuzzcheck run` on your target with the `tmin` command and an
`--input-file` option.

```bash
cargo fuzzcheck run target1 tmin --input-file "artifacts/crash.json"
```

This will repeatedly launch the fuzzer in “minify” mode and save the
artifacts in the folder `artifacts/crash.minified`. The name of each artifact 
will be prefixed with the complexity of its input. For example,
`crash.minified/800--fe958d4f003bd4f5.json` has a complexity of `8.00`.

You can stop the minifying fuzzer at any point and look for the least complex
input in the `crash.minified` folder.

## Creating a Mutator

If you would like to fuzz-test your own custom type `T` without the 
`DefaultMutator` derive attribute, you will have to create a type that conforms
to the `Mutator<T>` trait.

This trait can be a bit difficult to implement, but it is very powerful and it
is possible to write efficient and composable mutators with it. For 
example, fuzzcheck implements `U8Mutator` (u8), `OptionMutator` (Option), and
`VecMutator` (Vec). They compose such that it possible to use a 
`VecMutator<VecMutator<OptionMutator<U8Mutator>>>` to fuzz values of type 
`Vec<Vec<Option<u8>>>`. A number of other mutators are already defined:
`TupleMutator` for all types that have a tuple-like structure as well as
`EnumNPayloadMutator` for all types that have an enum-like structure containing
`N` items that have associated data.

Furthermore, the `fuzzcheck_mutators_derive` crate offers a proc_macro that
can choose a default mutator for user-defined types automatically.

I would like to write a guide to fuzzcheck to explain the trait and how to work
with it. But in the meantime, if you have questions, please send me an email or
create an issue on GitHub.

My goal is to write more mutators for common types and building blocks for 
composability such that a custom implementation of `Mutator<T>` is rarely 
needed.

## Previous work on fuzzing engines

As far as I know, evolutionary, coverage-guided fuzzing engines were
popularized by [American Fuzzy Lop (AFL)](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).  
Fuzzcheck is also evolutionary and coverage-guided.

Later on, LLVM released its own fuzzing engine, 
[libFuzzer](https://www.llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html), which is based on the
same ideas as AFL, but it uses Clang’s 
[SanitizerCoverage](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html) and is
in-process (it lives in the same process as the program being fuzz-tested.  
Fuzzcheck is also in-process and also uses SanitizerCoverage.

Both AFL and libFuzzer work by manipulating bitstrings (e.g. `1011101011`).
However, many programs work on structured data, and mutations at the
bitstring level may not map to meaningful mutations at the level of the
structured data. This problem can be partially addressed by using a compact
binary encoding such as protobuf and providing custom mutation functions to
libFuzzer that work on the structured data itself. This is a way to perform
“structure-aware fuzzing” ([talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60hC16HEDY),
[tutorial](https://github.com/google/fuzzer-test-suite/blob/master/tutorial/structure-aware-fuzzing.md)).

An alternative way to deal with structured data is to use generators just like
QuickCheck’s `Arbitrary` trait. And then to “treat the raw byte buffer input 
provided by the coverage-guided fuzzer as a sequence of random values and
implement a “random” number generator around it.” 
([cited blog post by @fitzgen](https://fitzgeraldnick.com/2019/09/04/combining-coverage-guided-and-generation-based-fuzzing.html)). 
The tool `cargo-fuzz` has
[recently](https://fitzgeraldnick.com/2020/01/16/better-support-for-fuzzing-structured-inputs-in-rust.html) 
implemented that approach.

Fuzzcheck is also structure-aware, but unlike previous attempts at
structure-aware fuzzing, it doesn't use an intermediary binary encoding such as
protobuf nor does it use Quickcheck-like generators.
Instead, it directly mutates the typed values in-process.
This is better many ways. First, it is faster because there is no
need to encode and decode inputs at each iteration. Second, the complexity of
the input is given by a user-defined function, which will be more accurate than
counting the bytes of the protobuf encoding.
Finally, and most importantly, the mutations are faster and more meaningful 
than those done on protobuf or `Arbitrary`’s byte buffer-based RNG.
A detail that I particularly like about fuzzcheck, and that is possible only 
because it mutates typed values, is that every mutation is done **in-place**
and is reversable. That means that generating a new test case is super fast, 
and can often even be done with zero allocations.

As I was developing Fuzzcheck for Swift, a few researchers developed Fuzzchick
for Coq ([paper](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/fuzzchick-draft.pdf)). It 
is a coverage-guided property-based testing tool implemented as an extension to
Quickchick. As far as I know, it is the only other tool with the same philosophy
as fuzzcheck. The similarity between the names `fuzzcheck` and `Fuzzchick` is a 
coincidence.
